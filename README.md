# Peer-to-Peer-Default-Loss-Prediction
This solution predicts the Loss due to default of the borrowers who are most likely to default on their Consumer loans in Peer-to-Peer lending. During the training stage, the solution understands the dataset, handles missing data and class imbalance, conducts feature interaction on the training data and selects a subset of best features based on feature importance. It then trains on multiple ML models, identifies the best performing model and tunes it accordingly. This trained model is then selected for prediction on the test data.
# Product Highlight
* This solution takes Peer-to-Peer consumer loan data as input, pre-processes the data, picks out the best features based on feature importance, trains it on several models and gets the best model and predicts the test data, thereby reducing the risk of lending to defaulters and expected loss to the lender.

* The algorithm is specifically trained on loan details pertaining to Peer-to-Peer consumer loans using machine learning.

* Mphasis HyperGraf is an omni-channel customer 360 analytics solution. Need customized Deep Learning/NLP solutions? Get in touch!
